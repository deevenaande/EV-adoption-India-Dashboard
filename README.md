🚗⚡ EV Adoption Analysis in India (Power BI)
 Problem Statement

Electric Vehicles (EVs) are gaining momentum in India as a sustainable alternative to traditional fuel-based transportation. However, understanding how EV adoption has evolved over time and across regions is crucial for identifying growth patterns and adoption drivers.

This project aims to analyze Electric Vehicle adoption in India using unit-based sales data to uncover trends across:

Years and months (up to 2024)

States and Union Territories

Vehicle categories and classes

 Note: The dataset does not include revenue or pricing information. The analysis focuses purely on units sold, making it an adoption-focused study rather than a financial one.

📊 Dataset

The dataset contains:

State-wise EV sales quantity

Year and month of sales

Vehicle category (2-Wheeler, 3-Wheeler, 4-Wheeler, Others)

EV vehicle class (E-scooter, E-rickshaw, Electric car, etc.)


📈 Key Insights

Total EV sales exceed 3.5 million units, indicating strong nationwide adoption.

2-Wheelers dominate EV adoption, accounting for nearly half of total units sold.

3-Wheelers play a significant role, especially in commercial and shared mobility.

4-Wheelers currently have lower adoption, likely due to higher costs and infrastructure dependency.

States such as Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Delhi lead in EV adoption.

Monthly sales reveal seasonal trends, while Year-on-Year analysis shows consistent growth, especially in recent years.

E-scooters and E-rickshaws are the most widely adopted EV vehicle classes.

🛠 Tools Used

Microsoft Power BI

Data cleaning and transformation

Time-series analysis

Interactive dashboards with slicers and KPIs

✨ Conclusion

This project demonstrates how units sold alone can provide meaningful insights into market adoption trends. It also marks my first step into building interactive dashboards using Power BI, focusing on clarity, storytelling, and real-world relevance.
